note:
* Like most computer hardware, hard disks have undergone major changes over the years.
* The result is that there are a large number of disk types and drivers for all these disks and their interface hardware.
* This wealth of hardware means that it’s sometimes necessary to fine-tune disk access to optimize Linux’s disk performance.
* To do this, you must first understand the various disk devices so that you can correctly identify your own disk hardware and learn what resources it uses.
* You can then employ any of a handful of utilities to optimize the way your system accesses the disks.
* Some disk tuning operations can be handled by higher-level utilities than those described here.
